DATA ANALYTICS END-TO-END PROJECT USING POWER BI


Hi DAPH - Data Analytics Philippines DataSense Analytics

Here's my first ever Power Bi Dashboard project after taking lectures from Microsoft Learn that the DAPH challenge provided including the replay video discussion/tutorials. I'm open for feedbacks, suggestions and recommendations as a first timer.

Dataset use is from Kaggle -https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hbugrae/best-selling-steam-games-of-all-time

Struggle: I don't have a windows laptop, I'm using my Macbook Pro M2 which doesn't support Power BI Desktop. I downloaded VMware Fushion to install windows and for me to use PBi. Sometimes it's laggy, most of the time freezes and crashes whenever I'm doing something with my project/dataset, making it more time consuming. I know I can improve more yet since I have this kind of struggle this is the only output I can present as of now.

About the project - it will show the top 5 analysis based on Rating, Price, and Downloads based from the dataset. Also it will show each games average Ratings, Difficulty, Price (Sum), Downloads per Game and the Genre when you toggle the game list.
